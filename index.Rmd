# Welcome to the WHO Lab!

## About the lab
Welcome to the lab of Dr. Xindi (Cindy) Hu, Assistant Professor in Environmental and Occupational Health at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. Our mission is to study how clean drinking water and other environmental factors impact population health and health disparities. We conduct rigorous and policy-relevant research to generate evidence at a large scale, leveraging transdisciplinary approaches spanning exposure science, geospatial data science, and health informatics. To learn more about the lab, visit [xindicindyhu.org](https://xindicindyhu.org/).
