# WHO Lab Manual

This repository contains the **Water, Health, Opportunity (WHO) Lab Manual** at the George Washington University.  
It documents lab onboarding, practices, policies, and resources for new and current lab members.  

The manual is built with **Bookdown (R Markdown)**. You can run it locally, edit content, and render an updated version of the manual.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/who-lab-manual.git
cd who-lab-manual
```
### 2. Open in RStudio

Double-click the .Rproj file (who-lab-manual.Rproj) to open the project in RStudio.
Alternatively, open R in the project folder.

### 3. Running the Manual Locally (Bookdown)

Install R packages (first time only):
```bash
install.packages(c("bookdown", "rmarkdown"))
```

Build and preview the manual:
```bash
bookdown::serve_book()
```

This will open a local preview in your browser.
The manual updates automatically whenever you save a file.

### 4. Editing Content

Chapters are written in .Rmd (R Markdown) files.

Because `_bookdown.yml` does not list rmd_files, Bookdown builds chapters in this order:

- index.Rmd (must exist, becomes the Welcome page)

- All other .Rmd files in alphanumeric order

To add a new chapter

Create a new `.Rmd` file (e.g., `17-datasets.Rmd`).

Save it in the repo root.

Give it a numeric prefix so it appears in the desired order.

Run `bookdown::serve_book()` again to preview.

### 5. Publishing Updates

When you're ready to publish changes:
By default, the rendered HTML is saved to the docs/ folder (set in _bookdown.yml).

You can host the manual on GitHub Pages:

- Go to your repo â†’ Settings â†’ Pages.

- Under Source, choose Deploy from a branch.

- Select branch: main, folder: /docs.

- Save.

Your manual will be published at https://water-health-opportunity-lab.github.io/who-lab-manual/.
